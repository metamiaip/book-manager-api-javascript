### Tasks

Here are some tasks for you to work on:

ðŸ“˜ Task 1: Implement the following User Story with tests.

`User Story: As a user, I want to use the Book Manager API to delete a book using its ID`


ðŸ“˜ Extension Task: Oh no! ðŸ˜­ We've only covered the happy paths in the solution, can you figure out a way
to add in exception handling to the project? 

- Clue 1: What if someone wants to add a book with an ID for a book that already exists? How do we handle this gracefully?


- Clue 2: What if someone wants to find a book by an ID that doesn't yet exist? 
  How can we improve the API by handling errors gracefully and show a helpful message to the client?

API Call Syntax:
- To return all books in the DB
  - GET /api/v1/books
- To return a single book in the DB
  - GET /api/v1/books/:bookId (e.g. GET /api/v1/books/1)
- To create a book in the DB
  - POST /api/v1/books
  - JSON body example
    {
        "bookId": 3,
        "title": "Book 3",
        "author": "Jonathan"
    }
- To update a book in the DB
  - PUT /api/v1/books/:bookId (e.g. PUT /api/v1/books/1)
  - if book update does not exist in the DB, return "Fail to update book!"
  - if book exists in the DB, update book to the DB and return "Update successful!"
- To delete a book in the DB
  - DELETE /api/v1/books/:bookId (e.g. DELETE /api/v1/books/1)
  - if book update does not exist in the DB, return "Fail to delete book!"
  - if book exists in the DB, delete book to the DB and return "Delete successful!"
